# Attention

## You should be using [RLBot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot) instead of RLSharp

RLBot link: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot

RLSharp is no longer being maintained as RLBot now has .NET support. RLSharp does not work with the current version of Rocket League, but RLBot does work.

Please use RLBot instead of RLSharp!
